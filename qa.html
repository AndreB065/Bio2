				<h1>Q&A with Andre</h1>
				<p><span class="question"><b>What is your first memory of using a computer?</b></span><br>
				  <span class="answer">- <em>My memory is not too good and I can't remember the sequence of things
				  that happened so long ago, but one of my earliest memories of using a computer is messing around with an
				  old IBM word processor my mom had.</em></span></p>
				<p><span class="question"><b>What was the first computer you bought and how powerful was it?</b></span><br>
				  <span class="answer">- <em>The first computer I ever bought for myself is the desktop that I currently use to 
				  this day, an Acer AM5100-B5404A, with an AMD Athlon 64X2 processor and 3GB of RAM.  It was pretty good for 2008.</em></span></p>
				<p><span class="question"><b>What was the first programming language you learned?</b></span><br>
				  <span class="answer">- <em>The first programming language I learned was C++.</em></span></p>
				<p><span class="question"><b>How did it come about that it became the first programming language you learned?</b></span><br>
				  <span class="answer">- <em>It's the first one I sat in a class to learn because it was what was suggested by my school 
				  advisor at the time.</em></span></p>
				<p><span class="question"><b>What languages have you programmed in? Which was the easiest? Why?</b></span><br>
				  <span class="answer">- <em>I've programmed with C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Python.  My memory is not too good, as I've mentioned, 
				  so I can't really say which was easiest.  The one that's in my mind now is the last one I used, JavaScript.  So, I would default to 
				  that being the easiest at the moment.  In a couple months, I'll probably be saying it's PHP.</em></span></p>
				<p><span class="question"><b>What is your favorite programming language? Why?</b></span><br>
				  <span class="answer">- <em>I can't say that I have a favorite programming language because I tend to fully 
				  immerse myself in the language I'm using at the time of the project.  It's almost like a new experience every time 
				  I switch to a different programming language.</em></span></p>
